Welcome to yapi linguistics!
Yapi Linguistics is your gateway to exploring the world's languages.


## About this project

Yapi linguistics Team wants to create an engaging, non gatekeeping linguistic classification system that isn't as closed as glottolog is. We welcome any ideas especially native speakers of languages that are not satisfied on how some langugaes are grouped. We are very open-minded when it comes to change.

Together we can grow this community (github link below).
